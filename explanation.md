### Explanation for Implementation Decisions

#### 1. Choice of Base Image

For the base image, I opted for Alpine Linux due to its lightweight nature. Alpine Linux offers a minimalistic and efficient environment, which is ideal for containerized applications. By using Alpine as the base image, the resulting Docker images are smaller in size, leading to faster build times, reduced network transfer times, and improved security by minimizing the attack surface.

#### 2. Dockerfile Directives

In the Dockerfile, I included necessary directives for building and running each container. These directives typically include instructions for installing dependencies, setting up the application environment, copying application code into the container, and specifying the command to execute when the container starts. Additionally, I ensured to follow best practices such as using multi-stage builds to keep the final image size minimal and reducing vulnerabilities.

#### 3. Docker-compose Networking

For networking in Docker-compose, I utilized bridge networking. Bridge networking provides a private internal network for communication between containers within the same Docker host. I allocated ports 5000 for the backend and 3000 for the frontend to allow external access to the respective services. By segregating the frontend and backend ports, I ensure that each service is independently accessible and can be scaled or managed separately.

#### 4. Docker-compose Volume Definition

In cases where persistent data storage is required, such as with MongoDB, I defined a volume named "data","/backend:/usr/src/app" and "/client:/usr/src/app" for both backend and frontend client respectively in the Docker-compose file. Volumes ensure that data persists even if the container is stopped or removed. By using volumes, I separate the data from the container filesystem, making it easier to manage and backup data independently of the container lifecycle.

#### 5. Git Workflow

To achieve the task, I followed a Git workflow that includes branching, committing changes, and merging branches as necessary. Each feature or task was developed on a separate branch to isolate changes and facilitate collaboration. Pull requests were used to review and merge changes into the main branch, ensuring code quality and stability. Additionally, I adhered to Git best practices such as writing descriptive commit messages and keeping the commit history clean and organized.

#### 6. Successful Running and Debugging Measures

During the implementation, I ensured successful running of the applications by thoroughly testing each component individually and as a whole system. If issues arose, I applied debugging measures such as logging, inspecting container logs, and using Docker debugging tools like `docker logs` and `docker exec`. I also utilized monitoring tools to track container performance and identify bottlenecks or errors in real-time.

#### 7. Docker Image Tag Naming Standards

For Docker image tagging, I followed the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) format. This format consists of three numbers separated by dots: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Each number represents a specific type of change in the software. Adhering to SemVer standards allows for easy identification and management of Docker images and containers, ensuring consistency and clarity across development, testing, and deployment environments.
